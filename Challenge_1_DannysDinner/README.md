11. BONUS QUESTION, Join All The Things:
We recreate the attached table output using the available data.

[Q11 Solution](https://github.com/BreakingPlaid/DannysDinerSQL/blob/main/DatawDannyWeek1Q11.sql)

12. BONUS QUESTION, Rank All The Things:
Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program. We recreate the attached table output using the available data.
