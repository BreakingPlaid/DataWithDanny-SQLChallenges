DataWithDanny-SQLChallenges
This repository contains my solutions to the 8 Week SQL Challenge, an initiative by Danny Ma designed to enhance SQL skills through practical case studies. Each case study presents unique business scenarios that require SQL-based data analysis to solve.

Case Studies
Danny's Diner: Analyze sales and membership data to derive customer insights for a fictional diner.​
reddit.com
Pizza Runner: Examine pizza delivery data to optimize operations and improve service efficiency.​
Foodie-Fi: Investigate subscription-based digital service data to understand customer engagement and retention.​
Data Bank: Work with financial data to assess customer portfolios and investment strategies.​
Data Mart: Analyze retail data to evaluate sales performance and inventory management.​
Note: As of now, only the first five case studies have been completed. Solutions to the remaining case studies will be added upon completion.​

Repository Structure
Challenge_X_CaseStudyName/: Directory containing all relevant files for each case study.​
ERD/: Entity-Relationship Diagrams illustrating the database schema.​
SQL/: SQL scripts used for data analysis and querying.​
Images/: Visualizations and plots generated from the analysis.​
