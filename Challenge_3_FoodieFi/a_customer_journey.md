## A. Customer Journey
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

## BreakingPlaid Solution: 

Well, instead of 8 sample customers, we decided to explore the entire dataset. It wasnt fun at first. But eventually, we learned worked it out. We learned about the window function lead to re-arrange our data around the plan changes by customer, so that we can calculate the patterns of plan changes by total numbers and avg time in days between plan changes.
