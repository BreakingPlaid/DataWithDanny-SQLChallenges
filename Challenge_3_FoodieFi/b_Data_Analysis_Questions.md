2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset â€” use the start of the month as the group by value.

**BP Solution**

```sql
    WITH months_CTE AS(
      SELECT

    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE plan_id = 0
      ORDER BY 1, 2
    )
    
    SELECT 
    	month_name,

4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

---
**Breaking Plaid Solution**

We've come up with two solutions. The first is a straightforward set of two CTEs, where total_customers gives us the customer total which we know to be 1,000 and churned_customers calculates the count of customers who have churned whcih we know to be 307. The final query calculates the percent using the above CTEs.

```sql
WITH total_customers AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total
    FROM subscriptions
),
churned_customers AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS churned
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE plan_id = 4
)
SELECT 
    churned AS churn_count,
    ROUND(100.0 * churned / total, 1) AS churn_percentage
FROM churned_customers, total_customers;
```
##### total_customers CTE:
| Description | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Total       | 1000   |

##### churned_cutomers CTE: 
| Churned |
|---------|
| 307     |


##### Final solution: 
| churn_count | churn_percentage |
|-------------|------------------|
| 307         | 30.7%            |

---
**Breaking Plaid Solution**

The All-in-Oneâ„¢ solution creates the count of 307 by counting all customers WHERE the plan_id = 4 (churn). It then creates the total customer count of 1,000 within a subquery, which is used as the denominator of the created column three. In one step we convert the data type to FLOAT, multiply by 100, and add a percentage sign. JOIN is added as a courtesy to read the name "churn" rather than hard-coding the column name in.

```sql
    SELECT
    	p.plan_name,
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as churn_count,
        
        CONCAT(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)/
        (SELECT 
         	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
         FROM subscriptions)
         ::FLOAT * 100, '%')
         AS churn_percent 
         
    FROM subscriptions s
    JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
    WHERE s.plan_id = 4
    GROUP BY 1;
```

| plan_name | churn_count | churn_percent |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| churn     | 307         | 30.7%         |
---


5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

---
**Breaking Plaid Solution**

Using the LEAD clause that we'd used a couple questions earlier, we decided to create a CTE that provides a side by side view of the original plan name with the next plan name for each customer. In the following SELECT statement, we queried the CTE and filtered the first column to only count the customers who had plan_name of "trial" and a next_plan as "churn" to find the numerator. Then we used a subquery to get the total customers, used that as the denominator and calculated that to get the trial to churn totals and total percent.

```sql
    WITH next_plan_CTE AS (
      SELECT
    	customer_id,
        start_date,
        plan_name,
        LEAD(p.plan_name) OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.plan_id) as next_plan
    FROM subscriptions s
    JOIN plans p ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
    ORDER BY customer_id, start_date
    )
    
    SELECT 
    	COUNT(*),
        CONCAT(COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions)::FLOAT * 100, '%') AS percentage_churn
    FROM next_plan_CTE
    WHERE plan_name = 'trial' AND next_plan = 'churn';
 ```

  WHERE
    plan_id != '0'
  GROUP BY

  ROUND(SUM(COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY last_plan_id)) / COUNT(*), 2) AS percentage
FROM
  first_plan_after_trial
GROUP BY

7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?
---

```sql
WITH start_date_CTE AS (
    SELECT 
        *, 
        LEAD(start_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY plan_id) AS next_date
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31'::DATE
)

SELECT 
    c.plan_id,
    p.plan_name, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) AS customer_count,  
    (CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) AS FLOAT) * 100.0 / 
        (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions)) AS percentage_customer
FROM start_date_CTE c
LEFT JOIN plans p ON c.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE c.next_date IS NULL OR c.next_date > '2020-12-31' 
GROUP BY c.plan_id, p.plan_name

8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
---
We learned that BETWEEN includes both the start and end values (as if using >= and <=).

```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(*) AS total_annual
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 3 and start_date BETWEEN '01-01-2020'::DATE AND '12-31-2020'::DATE
```

9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?

```sql
	SELECT
		customer_id,
		plan_id,
		start_date AS trial_date
	FROM subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id = 0
```

| customer_id | plan_id | trial_date                |
